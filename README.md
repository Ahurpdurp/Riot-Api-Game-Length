# Riot-Api-Game-Length
Simple script to gather data from the Riot API and calculate the average duration of League of Legends games from different patches

I'm currently testing out using the RIOT API for fun. This script (currently work in progress) will extract data from the most recent 
patches and calculate the average length of a legaue of legends match, separated by divison as well.
